# JFX Palette Designer

A custom control, meant to be embedded in a dialog box, for
designing indexed color palettes.

## Status

This control is in its early stages.  It lets you:

 - add a vintage palette (e.g., CGA, EGA, Web-Safe)
 - add a scaled set of colors to the palette
   - can create gray-scale, or interpolate any two colors
   - can choose how many color levels you want
 - Remove duplicate colors you may have added
 - Delete a color from the list by clicking on it
 - Quantizing an image to a given number of colors

Missing features I plan to add:

 - Move colors around the palette by dragging them.
